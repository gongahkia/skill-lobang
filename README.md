## Project Overview  
Skill Lobang is a web app designed to transform the SkillsFuture course discovery and selection experience. It helps users quickly find, compare, and optimize their SkillsFuture credit spending by letting them sort and filter courses by pricing, subsidy, availability, course start/end dates, frequency, provider ratings, and more. The app addresses the pain point of users with expiring or unused credits by highlighting relevant courses and offering actionable insights on maximizing benefit.

## Key Features  
- Aggregates SkillsFuture courses from public and private sources.  
- Allows sorting and filtering of courses by: price, subsidy, session frequency, start/end dates, available seats, and provider ratings.  
- Highlights courses optimal for users with soon-to-expire credits.  
- Provides ratings and reviews for each service provider.  
- Offers reminders or alerts for impending expiry of credits and upcoming course registration deadlines.  
- Responsive web UI for desktop and mobile.  
- Secure login, personal saved course lists and credit tracking.  
- Easy-to-use with clear, actionable insights for busy professionals.

## Technical Specifications

### Backend  
- Node.js + Express or Python (FastAPI/Flask) for API.  
- Scrapes or integrates with SkillsFuture course datasets and APIs.  
- Database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB) to store course info, reviews, provider data, user profiles.  
- Scheduled jobs to refresh course data and update expiring/soonest-starting courses.  

### Frontend  
- React 18+ and TypeScript, or Next.js for SSR optimization.  
- Filter/sort UI: price (low to high), dates, availability, subsidy, frequency, ratings.  
- Secure authentication.  
- Personalized dashboard showing expiring credits and suggested courses.  
- Rating/integrated reviews component.

### Deployment  
- Docker and CI/CD scripts for cloud deployment (Netlify, Vercel, AWS).

## Usage Example  

- Landing page: modern search/filter dashboard directly listing all courses by default.  
- Users create an account, see SkillsFuture credit balance, receive smart suggestions.  
- Can bookmark, rate, review courses, and set expiry reminder alerts.

## Deliverables  
- Full-stack multi-folder codebase with all core features.  
- Comprehensive README with setup, usage, and extension details.
- Test coverage for backend logic, UI, and course aggregation.

## Notes for Claude Code  
- Generate all code and folder structure, including backend, frontend, config files, and tests.
- Ensure clean separation of concerns between aggregation, API logic, and UI components.
- Prioritize user experience with clear flows and helpful suggestions/reminders for credit usage.
